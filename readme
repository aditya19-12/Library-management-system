# Library Management System

## Overview
Library Management System (LMS) is a simple digital library tool that helps librarians or staff manage book details, track issued books, and search book information in an organized manner.

This project replaces manual record-keeping with a digital process so that searching, adding, or issuing books becomes faster and error-free. It is completely built using Python and file handling making it suitable for beginner academic projects.

## Features

- Add and store books
- Save Book ID, Title, and Author
- Search books by title or author keyword
- Issue books to students/users
- Store issued details separately in text files
- View complete book list
- Fast search and accurate updates
- Easy modular structure for learning and extension

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- Basic file handling using text files (.txt)
- Modular coding (separate Python scripts for each function)
- No heavy external libraries required

## Requirements

Make sure you have:

- Python 3 installed
- A folder named "modules" containing the required .py files
- A folder named "data" to store the text files
- All .py files (main.py, add_book.py, view_books.py, issue_book.py, search_book.py)

Everything runs using standard Python. No internet or additional setup required.

## How to Run It on VS Code

### Step 1
Download/clone the complete project folder on your PC.
(Ensure the **modules** & **data** folders are present along with main.py)

### Step 2
Open VS Code → Click on **Open Folder** → Select the project folder

### Step 3
Open terminal inside VS Code and run:

### Step 4
A text-based menu will appear. Now you can:

- Add books
- View books
- Search book records
- Issue books to users

## Storage Information
All the data is automatically saved in simple `.txt` files inside `data/` folder such as:

- books.txt → stores book records
- issued_books.txt → stores issued book entries

No information is lost after program exit.
