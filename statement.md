# Library Management System — Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Library book data is mostly handled manually using registers or spreadsheets which makes record searching slow, error-prone, and difficult to update. It becomes hard to track which books are available or issued to whom.

This project solves these problems by shifting library operations to a computerized format. The system stores book details digitally, enabling fast searching, clean organization, and permanent storage using Python file handling.

The main goal is to make record tracking easier, more accurate and faster with very little technical setup.

## Scope of the Project

This project includes the following:

- Adding new books and storing required details
- Viewing complete available book list
- Searching book record using keyword input
- Issuing a book and saving the issued information
- Permanent record storage in text files for future reference
- CLI-based system for better portability and simplicity

It does **not** include GUI, online sync or database support to keep the project lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## Target Users

This system is mainly designed for:

- School/College Librarians
- Staff responsible for library management
- Python learners practicing file handling projects
- Students doing beginner-level academic projects

Anyone who needs a small offline library record tool without complex setup can use this system effectively.
